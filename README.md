# mimSim Simulation Software

mimSim is graphical discrete event simulation (DES) software made in Python with Python as a scripting language.

Entities are moving through blocks that are interconnected, forming a model. Blocks hold and route entities by also changing and examining their attributes. Entity mobility is restricted by using resource and barrier objects. The time mechanism is event-based, and the simulation strategy used is event scheduling. Using an experiment, it is possible to plan simulation execution. At the end of the simulation, a statistical report is generated. 

This software is still in the beta phase. It works, but some bugs are still present. If you encounter some unusual behavior, please report it to the author of this software.Â
